# My-Discord-Bot
Discord bot for my server using Discord.py

The bot has 3 iterations so far.
The first one was a test run to see if I can get the bot up and running at least.
The second one has a few commands that it can run for the user.
The third one is a full soundboard that I can edit for use later, playing videos based on a defined library (or videos straight from youtube or other sources).
